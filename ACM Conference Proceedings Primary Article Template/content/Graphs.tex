\section{Graphs}
Understanding how control flows through the program, how data moves between the variables, and how different program components
depend on each other is a very crucial thing to know before any analysis.

There are 4 different widely used graph structures for them namely Control Flow Graph (CFG), Value Flow Graph (VFG), Program Dependence Graph (PDG), and System Dependence Graph (SDG)
